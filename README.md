## Learning
---
* Strengthend my learning about the box model.
* Styling of border around images.
* Positioning using relative and absolute. 

In this project I learnt especially the fact that no technique is better than the other. However, certain techniques are more suited for some projects than others. Do not always have to make things complex, main aim is to solve the problem at hand given the tools that you have in your belt. Don't always have to use flexbox or CSS Grid, positioning and float work well as well.
